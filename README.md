This GitHub repository contains BrandSpark, a hackathon project designed to help businesses create personalized branding materials using AI. The website allows users to register, log in, and provide details about their business—such as its type, description, and specific needs. Based on this input, BrandSpark generates custom templates, flyers, emails, and catchy slogans using AI. Users can access a sleek dashboard to view and manage all their generated content, along with a count of the products they've created. BrandSpark aims to be an all-in-one branding solution for startups and small businesses.
