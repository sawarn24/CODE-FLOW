# CODE-FLOW
BrandSpark is a lightweight web application designed to help small businesses manage their content generation needs. Built using FastAPI for the backend and plain HTML/CSS for the frontend, the platform currently supports user registration and login with secure password hashing and JWT-based authentication. The database is managed using PostgreSQL, and tables are created automatically when the server starts. The frontend includes styled login and registration pages, and the backend is fully connected with proper CORS configuration to support integration with frontend components. This version lays the foundation for generating flyers, emails, and other business content powered by AI in future updates.
